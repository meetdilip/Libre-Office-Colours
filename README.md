Libre Office Branding Colour Palette for Inkscape and GIMP

When designing for Libre Office, TDF/Libre Office has some suggestions for you on which colours you are supposed to use. It can be found in the link below. The 30 colours they have mentioned there is a part of their well thought branding.

Once you add the .gpl file in this repository to `/home/myname/.config/inkscape/palettes` folder, you will get access to colour palette like this in Inkscape ( you need to select it from the arrow based menu ) for Ubuntu.

As for Windows 10, you can use C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\palettes
Mac users might find  ~/inkscape/palettes useful

I really hope this will be useful in creating great art work Libre Office.
