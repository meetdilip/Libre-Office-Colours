Libre Office Branding Colour Palette for Inkscape and GIMP

When designing for Libre Office, TDF/Libre Office has some suggestions for you on which colours you are supposed to use. It can be found in the link below. The 30 colours they have mentioned there is a part of their well thought branding. 000000 and ffffff are also included for ease of use

Once you add the .gpl file in this repository to `/home/myname/.config/inkscape/palettes` folder, you will get access to colour palette like this in Inkscape ( you need to select it from the arrow based menu ) for Ubuntu.

That's all. You have the palette, let your creativity flow :)

As for Windows 10, you can use C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\palettes<br>
<br>
Mac users might find  ~/inkscape/palettes useful
<br>

Since this is a .gpl file, it will work with GIMP as well.

I really hope this will be useful in creating great art work for Libre Office.
